# WICG-Proposal-Web-Modules
This is the Draft for the Web Modules proposal it superseeds and is a successor to webpackages and web bundels.


## Explainer
The old way to Deploy Apps for the web was called Packaging Bundling it was a way to mitigate common issues and speed up
the loading time of a Application on the Internet. 

Today the Internet has Changed. New Apis got added to browsers. New Runtimes got created which got 1:1 InterOp with browsers.
Also Internet Speeds are on a total other level today. While also new connection states got introduced like LieFi A state
where you got a Internet Connection with the strenght of a single Bar on your mobile phone. So to much to be disconnected
but less then needed to load anything.

Also Coding has changed new languages got invented as also new Coding Patterns and Paradigms that leave much of the old stuff
to history got invented.

This Implements the today version of how you should deliver apps from small to big there is nothing that changes anymore
we got new shiny solid standards. Combined out of the best of all worlds. Like the Reach of a Web Page combined with the nativ access
of a localhost Installation you do not need to choose anymore.
